# What are Git Repos?
A git **Repo** is a workspace which tracks and manages files withing a directory.  

# Git status
The following command gives information on the current status of a git repo and its contents:
```bash
$> git status
```

# Git init
Use the following command to create a new git repo. Before we can do anything git-related, we must initialize  a repo first:
```bash
$> git init
```

# Understanding .git directory
After issuing the `git init` command, a hidden directory called `.git` is created which holds all the `git` related stuffs. 
> Before running `git init`, use `git status` to verify that you are not currently inside a repo. 

- One repo per project!
